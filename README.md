Hello and welcome to my AT2 coding project, Beatbloom! The coding environment is Processing, the language is Javascript. This code is purely for artistic and creative purposes, inspired by the visuals I have observed at EDM music raves. I aimed to recreate these lively scenes and animations that move and react to the music. Once you run this code, the visual should appear on the screen and the microphone of your device will be accessed. This code will respond to ANY microphone input, so to test it, feel free to talk to it and see it respond to your voice! If you would like a specific song to play, please feel free to play 'DLMD' by Darren Styles.
